# Apokrinomai
## a simple mockserver

Apokrinomai is a simple mockserver that responds to requests with predefined reponses. **WORK IN PROGRESS**

### TODO:

- proper model for the the json files
- read responses on the fly from file (also: dynamically add new endpoints)
- cache reponses
- check for headers
- check request for fields

### nice to have:
- endpoint / webinterface for adding new responses
- choose randomly from multiple responses for one endpoint
